## Problems

Inevitably for commonly needed functionality, there may be multiple modules that provide the same functionality.
An example is JSON::Tiny and JSON::Fast. J/Fast was designed to be a drop-in replacement for J/Tiny, which
was first written to demonstrate how to use Perl6 and not as a workhorse module. However, for some reason J/Tiny
has a lot of support, although J/Fast is taking over (see the  ModuleCitation page to trace the historical change).

So the Task::Popular list may have alternate modules for the same functionality. But for a newcomer to the Ecosystem
that might in fact be interesting as it provides a choice, and the opportunity to compare coding styles.

## Updates and Algorithm

The aim is to update the list regularly (eg. monthly).

The algorithm for generating the distribution list is implemented as a method in the [ModuleCitation class](https://github.com/finanalyst/ModuleCitation).
